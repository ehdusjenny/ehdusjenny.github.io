mom being upset doesn't have anything to do with oppa, it's all between mom and dad..oppa didn't learn anything from dad. whenever oppa talks about gender, he's doing it to annoy me, nothing to do with mom..nothing to do with mom being woman..he does have resentments about being raised poorly but he's trying to get over it. mom has nothing to be upset about towards oppa in my opinion, only towards dad. mom's still misunderstanding oppa.
